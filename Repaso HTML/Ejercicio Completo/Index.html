			<p>
							I'll take an ocean in my stride <br/>
							Steal the stars and hitch a ride<br/>
							To your door<br/>
							And time builds a bridge through our bloodlines<br/>
							From the roots, we'll watch love rise<br/>
							Heaven knows how it grows<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							I won't let go<br/>
							Let my arms surround you<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							I can lay down with my ghost<br/>
							Now that I found you, don't go<br/>
							Don't go<br/>
							I'll be the branch that breaks your fall<br/>
							If you need me, make the call<br/>
							I'll be there<br/>
							And I know it's late for lullabies<br/>
							But the future's yours and mine<br/>
							Now and forevermore<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							I won't let go<br/>
							Let my arms surround you<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							I can lay down with my ghost<br/>
							Now that I found you, don't go<br/>
							Don't go<br/>
							(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							I won't let go<br/>
							Let my arms surround you (ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
							Now that I found you<br/>
							I can lay down with my ghost<br/>
							Now that I found you, don't go<br/>
